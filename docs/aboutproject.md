**Title**: [Robotics-Academy: exercises on Industrial Robot Manipulation with Moveit](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5878763952275456)  
**Organization**: JdeRobot - Universidad Rey Juan Carlos  
**Mentor**: Diego Martín  
**Abstract**: The goal of this project is to develop a set of robot manipulation exercises with incremental complexity for JdeRobot’s Robotic Academy users. Exercises include classical pick and place tasks without and with vision assistance, picking from warehouse racks with an industrial mobile manipulator, cooperation between AGV and fixed manipulator to pick objects from a conveyor belt and delivery to the target position.
With these exercises, users can gain a better understanding of the processing of a manipulation task which mainly includes perception, planning and control. They can also become more familiar with some popular working frameworks in robotics: ROS, Gazebo, MoveIt, and some well-known open-source computer vision libraries: OpenCV and PCL.
