        <title>Draft of document of third exercise</title>
        <description>
          
          This is a draft of the documentation of third exercise. The goal of this exercise is to practice integrating navigation and manipulation. You will need to use a mobile manipulator(AGV+robot arm+gripper) to pick objects on one conveyor and place them on three other conveyors. The mobile manipulator is MMO-500 robot...

          Convert Pointcloud to image The pcl_ros package provides a convert_pointcloud_to_image node to directly convert Pointcloud2 message to Image message, but it requires organized pointcloud which means each point in pointcloud corresponding to one image pixel. However, what we need to convert is filtered pointcloud which only contains points related to...
